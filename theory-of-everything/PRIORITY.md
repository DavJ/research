# PRIORITY CLAIM

These materials (graphics, equations, concepts) were publicly published in this GitHub repository (or its predecessor hosted at octonion-multiverse.com) between 2013 and 2015. Although the domain later expired, the core repository has remained unchanged and accessible.

This project was originally presented on the Google Sites website "Octonion Multiverse" (archived version dated Nov 2020, originally active from ~2013). The full structure and content have been preserved through a Google Takeout backup and include multiple articles covering the biquaternionic model of space-time, scalar field structures, and algebraic foundations of physical law.

The central idea is the use of **biquaternionic algebra** as a fundamental mathematical framework for describing the structure of space-time, energy distributions, and field dynamics. This includes derivations of field gradients, scalar and vector potentials, and energy expressions formulated in terms of biquaternions.

### Key points of originality:

- A consistent model of space-time as a **biquaternionic structure**, where components of spacetime and physical fields are encoded algebraically.
- The observation that **Pauli matrices and complexified quaternions (biquaternions) are mathematically interchangeable** and can serve as generators for both spinor and spacetime transformations.
- Early exploration of this algebraic foundation as a candidate for unifying physical interactions at a fundamental level.

These concepts were formulated and published independently, before the appearance of several later works on algebraic and emergent models of space and fields.
