# PRIORITY CLAIM

These materials (graphics, equations, concepts) were publicly published in this GitHub repository (or its predecessor hosted at octonion-multiverse.com) between 2013 and 2015. Although the domain later expired, the core repository has remained unchanged and accessible.

The central idea is the use of **biquaternionic algebra** as a fundamental mathematical framework for describing the structure of space-time, energy distributions, and field dynamics. This includes derivations of field gradients, scalar and vector potentials, and energy expressions formulated in terms of biquaternions.

### Key points of originality:

- A consistent model of space-time as a **biquaternionic structure**, where components of spacetime and physical fields are encoded algebraically.
- The observation that **Pauli matrices and complexified quaternions (biquaternions) are mathematically interchangeable** and can serve as generators for both spinor and spacetime transformations.
- Early exploration of this algebraic foundation as a candidate for unifying physical interactions at a fundamental level.

These concepts were formulated and published independently, before the appearance of several later works on algebraic and emergent models of space and fields.
